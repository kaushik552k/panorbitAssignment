## Dependencies I used to build this project:

Tailwind: To give an optimized stylings in fast pace projects

Axios: To fetch data from api

React Router Dom : For routing

## NOTE: I was not getting any data in api to check whether a user is active or not. Hence, I have set all users as active by default.
